#Marc de Bruijn
Web developer and graphic designer with a strong focus on the structural side of the design, as well as the technology behind it. We, being PUNTPIXEL, like to build systems, not decorative templates on top of them. This means we're often - if not always - responsible for the whole design process - including the conceptual phase, visual design and actual technical implementation of the design.
