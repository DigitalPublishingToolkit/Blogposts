> EBooks violate the fundamental promise of the Internet. Anyone can

> web hosting costs notwithstanding, the Internet empowers a seller to
> engage directly with a buyer. Ebooks break this promise; the writer
> should be able to engage directly with the reader. The writer should
> be able to sell directly to the reader. Imagine if you had to pay your
> web hosting company 30% of your gross every time you sold an item on
> your website—that’s exactly what eBookstores do. […] The fact that
> paper books have traditionally been sold in bookstores does not mean
> that an “online bookstore” is the only legitimate place to sell
> eBooks. In fact, an online bookstore is no different than any other
> e-commerce company that displays and sells the products in its
> database. Downloading and installing book software should be no
> different than downloading and installing any other software. To be
> accurate, publishers can produce and distribute their own ePub eBook
> files but these still rely on dedicated eReader software or hardware.
