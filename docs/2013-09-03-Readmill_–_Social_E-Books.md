Michael Grothaus, a technology journalist, talked to Henrik Beggren, CEO
of a small but growing app Readmill. In his article [E-Books Could Be
The Future Of Social
Media](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3016658/e-books-could-be-the-ultimate-niche-social-networks) he
describes how Readmill approaches e-books as “its own self-contained
social network”, and how this can change book publishing on different
levels.

> “Talking with him, I discovered that compared to what Readmill is
> planning, today’s e-books might as well be dusty scrolls of parchment.
> In the future, e-books are going to explode beyond just containing
> stories, becoming niche social networks where we discuss our favorite
> passages with other readers and even authors and publishers buy our
> data to make more informed decisions. So hold on tight, book lovers.
> Reading as we know it will soon change, forever.” Source: [E-Books
