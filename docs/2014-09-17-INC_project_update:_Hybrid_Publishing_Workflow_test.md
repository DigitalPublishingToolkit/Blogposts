On the 12th of September the Institute of Network Cultures subgroup
organized a meeting to test  the initial results of their research.
Their project focuses on optimalising the publishing workflow for print
and electronic publications – developing a “hybrid publishing workflow”
that will make it easier and more sufficient to publish for several
platforms and formats. For this purpose they have researched and
developed several tools, and created manuals and visualisations that
will make this process accessible for a larger audience.

During the test day the tools and manuals were tested by several people
that each represented a certain role in this workflow: editor, designer,
and developer. Thanks to Andre Castro (developer and designer), Gert-Jan
van Dijk (Uitgeverij Duizend & Een) and his multimedia designer James
Fitzpatrick (Machined Arts Amsterdam), Menno Grootveld (Leesmagazijn),
Geert Lovink (INC), Margreet Riphagen (INC), and Caspar Treijtel (UvA,
University Library) we gained insights in the parts that still need to
be developed further. The results of this test day will be implemented
and published on the blog as soon as possible.

The results of this test day will be implemented, and published on the
blog as soon as possible!
