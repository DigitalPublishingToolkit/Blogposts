									<p><strong>In cooperation with BIS publishers, Essense kicked off their work with a research PDF that explores the digital publishing landscape.</strong></p>
<p>As we started working on this project we realized that the parties that participate in the ‘consortium’ have different levels of understanding of publishing in the digital realm. Also the field is overflowing with formats, standards and businessmodels. We therefore created a research PDF that firstly introduces the landscape of digital publishing, and secondly looks at research &amp; design issues that are relevant to the publisher (BIS) we are currently working with.</p>
<p>The <em>Landscape</em> PDF <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2013/07/LandscapeDigitalPubl_DPTSTIJL.pdf" title="research PDF">can be downloaded here</a>.</p>

<p>A Digital Publication Journey by Essense showing the route from <em>maker(s)</em> to <em>reader</em>, a vizualisation that also indicates players, platforms and Formats.</p>
<p>Our collegues of PuntPixel also created a comprehensive post about <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/06/digital-publications-in-practice/">Jargon, Platforms &amp; Publication Formats</a>.</p>
