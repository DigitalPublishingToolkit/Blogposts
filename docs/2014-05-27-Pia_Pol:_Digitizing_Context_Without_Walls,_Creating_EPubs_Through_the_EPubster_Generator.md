The publishing house Valiz publishes Context Without Walls (CWW), a
series of book publications focused on the work of artists from all over
the world. The books in this series are multilingual, rich in images and
text, and the design is meticulous. From the first publication in this
series, Common Skin, Valiz and their designers have attempted to create
a digital version.

It goes without saying that many difficulties arise when converting a
publication like Common Skin to the digital realm. How do you deal with
the richness of the visual language and the textual design of the book
version? What kind of format should be used? How can you make keywords
link to the indexes of the book? And what to do with all the footnotes
of each publication? As part of the Digital Publishing Toolkit
Initiative Valiz worked on the Epubster Generator tool to tackle these
questions.



With the Epubster Generator, an open source software tool for editing
and designing ebooks, a publisher can create EPub3s with a wide range of
extensive image and design options. But there is more, the Epubster
Generator

-   it’s ePubs can be sold to different platforms – a common problem of
    digital publishing
-   its style sheets can be amended and reused for different styles to
    create series
-   you can add style sheets and metadata – the latter is particularly
    important if you want to sell the book
-   you can use hyperlinks in text
-   both markdown and rich text can be used
-   changes in text and image can be made directly in the program

Pol explains that their focus has been on developing a tool that is both
easy to use and sustainable. However, there are some more style and
design problems that they need to tackle. How to deal with the page
divisions and centrefolds that are a crucial part of Common Skin? And
how can we make it completely bug-free? These are questions Pia Pol and
her team will be working on and seek solutions to during the last leg of
the Digital Publishing Toolkit development period.
