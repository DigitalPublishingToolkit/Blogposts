The ePub version of the [Unlike Us
Reader](http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/portal/publication/unlike-us-reader-social-media-monopolies-and-their-alternatives/),
published by INC, is available. It can be downloaded
[here](https://bitly.com/1399MUd).

This e-book represents the first experimental attempt to provide more
digital versions of INC Readers.

It was developed using InDesign CS6. The adopted procedure is documented
[here](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/).
