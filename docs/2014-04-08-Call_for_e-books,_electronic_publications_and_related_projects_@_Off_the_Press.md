**Off the Press – Electronic Publishing in the Arts: Call for e-books,
electronic publications and related projects on Friday 23rd of May, from
16.30 – 17.30**

To illustrate
the scope and potential of electronic publishing we would like to invite
artists, designers, publishers and other practitioners in the field of
electronic publishing to showcase their e-books, electronic publications
and related projects in an informal setting to the public during the
Bazaar we organize at the event Off the Press.

Off the Press
will take place on the 22nd and 23rd of May 2014 at Museum Boijmans van
Beuningen and WORM in Rotterdam. It consists of a two-day conference
with speakers such as Alessandro Ludovico, Elizabeth Castro, Adam Hyde,
Badlands Unlimited and Florian Cramer, an arts & Crafts session,
workshops, and a Bazaar with Drinks. The following questions will be
addressed: How can arts publishers make their own e-publications and use
the medium in a conceptually and aesthetically interesting way? How do
new forms of digital publishing change the role of the designer? What
change is needed in your production workflow, from manuscript to
publication, if you want to switch to hybrid electronic and paper
publishing?

If you would
like to showcase your work or project at the Bazaar on Friday the 23rd
please forward your proposal (Max 1 A4, max 4 visuals, and please
indicate what technical equipment you would need) to
<kimmy@networkcultures.org>. The deadline for
proposals is the 22nd of April 2014.

Please note that contributions from abroad are welcomed. However, we
cannot offer any accommodations or travel expenses.

Off the Press:
Electronic Publishing in the Arts is part of the research project
Digital Publishing Toolkit initiated by INC. It is a network of two
applied universities and art school research departments, four Dutch art
and design publishers and several graphic and media design bureaus,
which are  working on an accessible “how-to” guide for electronic
publishing in the arts along with a collection of open source software
tools for editing and designing electronic books.
