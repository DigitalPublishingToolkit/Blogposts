Michelle Kasprzak, curator at [V2\_, Institute for the Unstable
Media](http://v2.nl/) in Rotterdam, introduced participants of Off the
Press to the creation of an e-book series aimed to complement the events
run by V2\_. Michelle begun by briefly outlining the history and
activities of the institute.

The Institute for the Unstable Media started in 1981 as an artist
collective in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. The theoretical
principles of V2\_ were laid down in 1987 with the “Manifesto for
Unstable Media”, which grew out of dissatisfaction with the status quo
in the visual arts at the time. In 1994, V2\_ moved to its current
location in the city centre of Rotterdam.

The idea behind the e-book series was to create ‘legacy objects’ for
those who could not attend the actual events run by the institute. The
events in question include [DEAF – Dutch Electronic Art
Festival](http://v2.nl/events/deaf), [Test\_Lab
series](http://v2.nl/events/test_lab_series),
[Blowup\_series](http://v2.nl/events/blowup), as well as
[others.](http://v2.nl/events) Regarding the institute’s style, Michelle
stated that their two main approaches – mixing old and new content, and
reframing – allows V2\_ to remain agile and be flexible to adjust to the
hot topic of the time.

the Unstable Media organises [Book Sprints](http://www.booksprints.net/)
– time-limited (5 days) collaborative book writing. Michelle is
responsible for curating participating groups and choosing participants
from different backgrounds to come together as an efficient writing
group. Michelle remarked that Book Sprints are like weddings : they
bring best and worst in people.
