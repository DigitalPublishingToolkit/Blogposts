Bibliotecha



The last session of Off the Press was opened by André Castro, who
introduced participants to the Bibliotecha project. André is a sound
artist from Lisbon, currently living in Rotterdam. He completed the
Master’s program of Media Design and Communication at the [Piet Zwart
Institute](http://pzwart.wdka.nl/home/) in 2013, and graduated in 2007
from the Sonic Arts BA program at Middlesex University. He developed
Bibliotecha in collaboration with : [Yoana Buzova
,](http://oyoana.com/)Lasse van den Bosch Christensen, [Max
Dovey,](http://www.maxdovey.com/)[Michaela
Lakova](http://www.maxdovey.com/) and [Roel Roscam
Abbing](http://www.roelroscamabbing.nl/).

Andre Castro explaining the specificities of Bibliotecha



André explained the motivation behind creating Bibliotecha as
frustration with sharing knowledge. As he explained, due to legal
regulations, lecturers at universities couldn’t upload texts online and
students wanted to be able to share study materials outside the
university regulations. Paradoxically, EPUBs are less shareable than
print books, because there are no indexed databases where one could find
extensive range of publications on particular topic (as opposed to
highly organised library collections). As a result, a Hackaton dedicated to finding solution
for sharing ePubs resulted in the prototype of Bibliotehca. The idea was
initiated by Marcel Mars and Femke Snelting at Impact Festival Utrecht.

In technical terms, Bibliotecha is a framework to facilitate the local
distribution of digital publications within a small community. It relies
on a microcomputer running open-source software to serve books over a
local wifi hotspot. Using the browser to connect to the library one can
retrieve or donate texts. Bibliotecha proposes an alternative model of
distribution of digital texts that allows specific communities to form
and share their own collections.The Bibliotecha grows organically with
each member adds EPubs and thus the community grows. They work with
Raspberry Pie software and Calibre.
