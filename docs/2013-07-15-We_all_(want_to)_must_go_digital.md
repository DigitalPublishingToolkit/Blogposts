## The lessons publishers can learn from the music,

> Resume:*“What are profitable business models, currently used in the
> music, film and game industry, which could be useful for Meulenhoff
> Boekerij with selling e-books in the fiction genre?”* By conducting
> both desk research and field research Meulenhoff Boekerij can be
> advised about this complex situation.
>
> The desk research consists of a search to various business models in
> the music, film and game industry. To the basis of examples we decided
> if the business models are suitable for selling e-books in the fiction
> genre. It looks like the retail model, the subscription model, the
> free-model and the advertisers model are suitable. Afterwards, we
> looked at examples from abroad. The hopes were high Dutch publishers
> could learn from the developments in the English speaking parts of the
> world, but we got disappointed. Most of their innovative publishing
> ideas were more suitable for the non-fiction genre or would not work
> in the Netherlands due to this complex distribution system. Dutch
> publishers are in a difficult situation, which cannot be compared to
> the American circumstances.
>
> The field research started with ten unstructured in-depth interviews.
> The respondents were five experts from the book industry and five
> experts from the music, film and game industry. Their advice to
> Meulenhoff Boekerij is to offer, together with other Dutch publishing
> houses, convenience for a fair price.
>
> Afterwards we conducted a focus group with four authors. They see
> e-books as an add-on product and they are convinced of the fact the
> paper book will subsist. The authors affiliate with the experts when
> it comes to the sales channel: this has to be a collaborating online
> platform which offers all the e-books published by Dutch publishing
> houses.
>
> To draw the final conclusion: not Meulenhoff Boekerij should use the
> business models to sell e-books in the fiction genre, but there has to
> be a collaboration online platform with all the e-books from the Dutch
> publishing houses. These would all be divided in different genres and
> every genre would have its own ambassador. The ambassadors help
> consumers to pick the right e-book. E-books can be paid apiece, but
> consumers can also take a subscription. Other business models that can
> be used are the advertisers model and the free-model.
