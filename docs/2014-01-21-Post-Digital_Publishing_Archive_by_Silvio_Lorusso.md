Recently Silvio Lorusso launched the Post-Digital Publishing Archive
(P-DPA). The aim of [P-DPA](http://p-dpa.net/about/) is to
systematically collect, organize and keep trace of experiences in the
fields of art and design that explore the relationships between
publishing and digital technology. The archive acts as a space in which
the collected projects are confronted and juxtaposed in order to
highlight relevant paths, mutual themes, common perspectives,
interrelations, but also oppositions and idiosyncrasies. Pâ€”DPA is
maintained by Silvio Lorusso.
