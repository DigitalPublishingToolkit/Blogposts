<p>Oliver Wise, together with Eleanor Hanson are the co-founders of The Present Group, a creative studio creating affordable and sustainable models for funding artists. In their first three years, their <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/faq?tpg=about">subscription art project</a> has channeled over $20,000 toward funding artist projects, stipends, and development of critical essays. In May 2010 they began a <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/hosting">web hosting project</a> where a portion of the fees fund prizes for contemporary artists. Hosting clients get to vote on the recipient of each grant. At Off the Press Oliver presented their latest project, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.holartbooks.com/">Hol Art Books</a>, <a href="http://beta.thepeoplesebook.net/">The People’s E-book,</a> a free <span class="author-g-dwr39rz122z8rgu2txun">online e-book creation tool. The enterprise started on Kickstarter and raised three times the pledged goal, with 920 backers.</span></p>
<p>The goal, Oliver said, was to make the People’s E-book as simple as possible to encourage and facilitate experimentation with the medium. <span id="more-1594"></span>Given the EPUB’s finicky nature, Oliver and his colleagues decided to strip it down to bare essentials: title, cover image and page(s). In order to make The People’s E-book as user-friendly as possible, instead of Markdown, it uses a WYSIWYG interface. This, however, created some problems, since WYSIWYG, being designed to work in browsers, offers a range of options which would not work on e-readers. To prevent any potential problems with display and re-flowability, the WYSIWYG had to be restricted to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The choice of EPUB as the format was justified by the following :</p>

<div id="magicdomid214"><span class="author-g-dwr39rz122z8rgu2txun">it works offline, is self-contained and facilitates safe archiving of texts, as opposed to websites and links</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid215"><span class="author-g-dwr39rz122z8rgu2txun">for text, EPUB can be read on a variety of devices using free apps and brings general good reading experience</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid216"><span class="author-g-dwr39rz122z8rgu2txun">people buy it, so artists can use EPUB publications as a source of supplementary income</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid217"><span class="author-g-dwr39rz122z8rgu2txun">it’s less ephemereal, as opposed to social media, which are designed to be consumed instantly and flow through. EPUB offers a slower and more stable kind of experience.</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oliver expressed the hope that maybe one day EPUB will take on a life of its own, like the GIF format, with thousands of people around the world self-identifying themselves as GIF artists. One of the further experiments undertaken by Oliver and Eleanor with EPUB format is the <a href="http://streambooks.thepeoplesebook.net/#/stream">Streambooks</a>, a tool allowing to convert any <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" class="broken_link">Tumblr</a> blog into an e-book.</p>
