here.

Corrections form a large part of the process of making a book, whether
it is in print or electronic. Handling corrections posed one of the
biggest challenges to the INC research team and the ideal solution is
still not found. To start with the conclusions:

**Conclusion 1**: work towards a document as clean as possible before
sending it to the designer and developer because this saves a huge
amount of work (see also our post on the [style
guide](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/10/21/style-guide-for-hybrid-publishing/)).
This is mainly due to:

**Conclusion 2**: it seems impossible to avoid multiple work on
corrections, meaning both editor, designer, and developer might have to
put them through in their respective files.

**Conclusion 3**: not all corrections are relevant for all publication
formats; different kinds of corrections are made in different locations.
An example are hyphenations, which are specific to a desktop publishing
file, and do not play a role in a digital file.

**A little pre-history**

**Markdown**[workflow

**Types of corrections**

-   spelling mistakes
-   minor style issues
-   design issues: loose lines on top or bottom of the page,
    hyphenation, blank pages, white space between words, â€¦
-   images: quality of the image, captions, placing of the images
    relative to the text
-   et cetera

Below is an example of a standard spread marked with editorial
corrections, including spelling, hyphenation, and design questions.

**Place of corrections**

The corrections are usually marked by the editor and then issued to the
designer, who will process them in the InDesign file, and to the
developer who will do the same in the EPUB. Text corrections need to be
processed in both files in the same way. Design- or lay-out specific
corrections can be divided in desktop publishing corrections
(InDesign-only) and design and technology corrections in the EPUB. This
means a distinction has to be made. To return to the example of
hyphenation: an incorrect hyphenations is specifically a problem of the
desktop publishing file and needs to be manually adapted there, while
playing no role in the HTML file. The same goes for white spaces that
are too big or small; or the other way around, for links in the EPUB
that do not work, or headers which do not appear in the Table of
Contents.
