**In cooperation with BIS publishers, Essense kicked off their work with
a research PDF that explores the digital publishing landscape.**

As we started working on this project we realized that the parties that
participate in the ‘consortium’ have different levels of understanding
of publishing in the digital realm. Also the field is overflowing with
formats, standards and businessmodels. We therefore created a research
PDF that firstly introduces the landscape of digital publishing, and
secondly looks at research & design issues that are relevant to the
publisher (BIS) we are currently working with.

The *Landscape* PDF [can be downloaded

Our collegues of PuntPixel also created a comprehensive post about
[Jargon, Platforms & Publication
Formats](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/06/digital-publications-in-practice/).
