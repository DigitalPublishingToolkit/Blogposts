# Angie Keefer: The difference between the two {.entry-title .single-title itemprop="headline"}

Angie Keefer is a writer, artist, and co-founder of [The Serving
Library](http://www.servinglibrary.org/), along with David Reinfurt and
Stuart Bailey of [Dexter Sinister](http://www.dextersinister.org/).

The Serving Library, as described by Keefer, is a cooperatively-built
archive that assembles itself by publishing means. It first releases
e-publications of the artworks and texts of various artists under PDF
format, for free (but only for a period of six months), after which the
latter are printed and sold.

However, Keefer’s presentation specifically focused on the house font of
The Serving Library – called Meta-the-Difference-Between-the-Two font,
based on the typesetting language of Tex – and how its digital origins
relate to design possibilities. She allowed the audience to delve into
the video titled “[Letter & Spirit](http://vimeo.com/65248695)”. The
18-minute production presents both a history and a philosophy of fonts
by simultaneously playing with the animated typing it uses to convey the
message.
