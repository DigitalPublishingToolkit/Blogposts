									<p>The pursuit of hybrid publishing – aiming at different output formats, both print and electronic, for a single title – means reconsidering your workflow from the first step to the last. A well thought-through style guide is essential to make this transition to hybrid publishing efficient, time- and money-wise. The style guide is sent to the authors or contributors and defines how you receive your documents or manuscripts. Adapting your style guide so it fits your hybrid publishing goals beforehand will save a lot of time in production!</p>
<p>The Institute of Network Cultures has worked on the development of a hybrid workflow, which is described in detail <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/10/07/hybrid-workflow-how-to-introduction-editing-steps/">on this blog</a>: steps for the editor to follow, for the print book designer, and for the ebook developer. In that manual we start from the point where the definitive manuscript of the author is handed in and follow as it is made into a InDesign/PDF document and an EPUB.</p>
<p>However, the workflow will without a doubt gain in efficiency when there is attention paid to the nascent state of a publication as well: the style guide used by a publishing house. In what follows the INC style guide will be given as an example of how to adjust your publishing style guide in such a way as to cater for a hybrid publishing workflow.</p>
<p>We’ll focus solely on the issues at stake in the transition to a combined print and electronic workflow and will leave other elements of the style guide aside. A copy of the style guide as used by the INC can be downloaded <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2014/10/Styleguide_INC__2014.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>INC books are published on paper, as PDF, and in print-on-demand and are freely available from the INC website. For more information on INC publications, visit <a href="http://networkcultures.org/publications">networkcultures.org/publications</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999;"><b>Language style</b></span></p>
<p><b>Document Formatting / Layout:</b></p>
<p><i>General</i>- Submissions should be sent preferably in .docx.</p>
<p><i>We chose this format because of the editing and rewriting that is still going on in this phase. Therefore the author is not asked specifically to hand in a markdown file (see also the blog post about corrections (forthcoming)). Of course, if the author is apt at working in markdown, this is possible.</i></p>
<p>The following points are about the formatting of the Word file:<b>Normal</b> style as default.<b>Heading 1</b> style, article sections should have <b>Header 2</b> and subsections <b>Header 3</b> style.<i>italics</i> where needed (references, emphasis on single words).</p>
<p><i>The URLs will be made clickable in a later stadium so they function correctly in the PDF and EPUB. URLs in the footnotes however should be clickable.</i></p>
<p><i>Footnotes and referencing</i>- All references should be auto-inserted footnotes (in other words, no in text references that use parentheses/brackets). For example, <i>not: </i>Off the Press discusses the question of digital publishing (Lorusso, 2013). <i>But</i>: Off the Press discusses the question of digital publishing.<a title="" href="#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>- All references should also be collected into a Reference list at the end of the article. Please do not use an automated reference list, or disable the macro after you finish making it this way.<span style="color: #999999;">[…]</span></p>
<p><i>Quotations</i><i>Blockquotes will be marked with &gt; in markdown and should be highly visible in the original document, so the conversion can be checked easily</i><span style="color: #999999;">[…]</span></p>
<p><b>Images:</b>- Authors must have copyright to the images, or permission to use them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><b>Word Choice:</b></span><span style="color: #999999;">Does not apply </span></p>
