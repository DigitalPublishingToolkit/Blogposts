> Anyone who truly wants to engage with the challenge posed by [the
> popularization of tablets] and be a part of evolving the medium of the
> “book” needs to take seriously the notion of digital-first content
> development. Being digital first means refusing to make the ebook
> version of your content an afterthought. The digital format of the
> book should not be merely a postproduction conversion of print-bound
> manuscript files; nor should it be an ex post facto “enhanced” version
> of content that has already been completed— for example, adding in a
> few video clips at the end of an otherwise static text. From
> conception to publication, true digital-first content is designed to
> take full advantage of the capabilities offered by dedicated ereaders,
> tablets, and smartphones to create something that is native to the
> platform.

> There is no other source content format better suited to the task of
> developing digital-first content for the diverse ecosystem of ereading
> devices than HTML5, because you can develop directly for the browser
> (ereader software engines are effectively specialized Web browsers).
> As I argue in “The Case for Authoring and Producing Books in
> (X)HTML5,” authoring in HTML5 makes it “trivial to
> integrate…digital-first elements directly into the manuscript”
