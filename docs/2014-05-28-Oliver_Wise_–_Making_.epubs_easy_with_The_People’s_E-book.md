Oliver Wise presenting how to use The People’s E-book.



Oliver Wise, together with Eleanor Hanson are the co-founders of The
Present Group, a creative studio creating affordable and sustainable
models for funding artists. In their first three years, their
[subscription art project](http://thepresentgroup.com/faq?tpg=about) has
channeled over \$20,000 toward funding artist projects, stipends, and
development of critical essays. In May 2010 they began a [web hosting
project](http://thepresentgroup.com/hosting) where a portion of the fees
fund prizes for contemporary artists. Hosting clients get to vote on the
recipient of each grant. At Off the Press Oliver presented their latest
project, in collaboration with [Hol Art
Books](http://www.holartbooks.com/), [The People’s
E-book,](http://beta.thepeoplesebook.net/) a free online e-book creation tool. The
enterprise started on Kickstarter and raised three times the pledged
goal, with 920 backers.

The goal, Oliver said, was to make the People’s E-book as simple as
possible to encourage and facilitate experimentation with the medium.
Given the EPUB’s finicky nature, Oliver and
his colleagues decided to strip it down to bare essentials: title, cover
image and page(s). In order to make The People’s E-book as user-friendly
as possible, instead of Markdown, it uses a WYSIWYG interface. This,
however, created some problems, since WYSIWYG, being designed to work in
browsers, offers a range of options which would not work on e-readers.
To prevent any potential problems with display and re-flowability, the
WYSIWYG had to be restricted to a certain extent.

The choice of EPUB as the format was justified by the following :

-   

    it works offline, is
    self-contained and facilitates safe archiving of texts, as opposed
    to websites and links

    

-   

    for text, EPUB can be
    read on a variety of devices using free apps and brings general good
    reading experience

    

-   

    people buy it, so
    artists can use EPUB publications as a source of supplementary
    income

    

-   

    it’s less ephemereal, as
    opposed to social media, which are designed to be consumed instantly
    and flow through. EPUB offers a slower and more stable kind of
    experience.

    

Oliver expressed the hope that maybe one day EPUB will take on a life of
its own, like the GIF format, with thousands of people around the world
self-identifying themselves as GIF artists. One of the further
experiments undertaken by Oliver and Eleanor with EPUB format is the
[Streambooks](http://streambooks.thepeoplesebook.net/#/stream), a tool
allowing to convert any [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) blog into an
e-book.
