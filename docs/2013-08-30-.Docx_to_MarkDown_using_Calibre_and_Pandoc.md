This post documents the outcomes of a new feature of
[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) available in version 1.0: docx
conversion. The docx file is firstly converted to HTMLZ in order to be
converted again to MarkDown through
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). An automated version of the
process (bash script) is available at the bottom.

We are going to use a test document provided by **Calibre** team,
downloadable [here](http://calibre-ebook.com/downloads/demos/demo.docx).
The document has the following features:

Test Document in .docx, shown in LibreOffice



-   Inline formatting
-   Fonts
-   Paragraph level formatting
-   Tables
-   Footnotes & Endnotes
-   Dropcaps
-   Links
-   Table of Contents
-   Images
-   Lists

First, we convert the .docx to HTMLZ using **Calibre**. To do so add the
test document to Calibre and right-click to convert it individually.

Choose HTMLZ as output format click OK. You will then find your .htmlz
in the containing folder of your document (right-click on the element \>
Open containing folder).

The HTMLZ is a
[zip](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2013/08/DOCX-Demo-Kovid-Goyal.zip)
file containing an HTML file along with images, style, etc. Therefore in
order to access those files simply change the extensions from .htmlz to
.zip and uncompress.

The result of the conversion is pretty decent: except for “Paragraph
level formatting”, everything else is preserved, especially footnotes
(that were the most labour intensive issue in the [previous
processes](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/07/notes-on-converting-a-doc-to-multimarkdown/)
and still not solved).

Let’s now use **Pandoc** to convert the .html to MarkDown.

    pandoc -f html -t markdown -o output.html your_forlder/index.html 

Here you can download the [output MarkDown
file](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2013/08/output.md).

Let’s now go through the features.

**Inline formatting**

-   Bold and italic are preserved, even though there are problems when
    they are one next to each other;
-   Underlined, struck out, superscript, subscript, colors, highlight
    are not preserved.

**Fonts**

**Paragraph level formatting**

**Tables**

**Footnotes & Endnotes**

**Dropcaps**

**Links**

**Table of Contents**

**Images**

**Lists**

### Automated version of the process (bash script)

In order to use the automated version you need:

1.  Calibre’s Command Line Interface activated: On OS X you have to go
    to Preferences-\>Advanced-\>Miscellaneous and click install command
    line tools to make the command line tools available. On other
    platforms, just start a terminal and type the command.
2.  An unzip tool: on OS X I use “unzip”.

<!-- -->

    #!/bin/bash
    mkdir temp
    cp $1 temp
    cd temp
    ebook-convert $1 output.htmlz
    unzip output.htmlz
    cd ..
    pandoc -f html -t markdown -o output.md temp/index.html
    rm -R temp
