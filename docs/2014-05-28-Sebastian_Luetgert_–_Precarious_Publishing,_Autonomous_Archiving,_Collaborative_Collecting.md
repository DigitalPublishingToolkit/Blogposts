Sebastian Luetgert, a.k.a. Robert Luxemburg, is a theorist and media
artist, copyleft advocate, programmer, writer, co-moderator of
[nettime](http://www.nettime.org/), member of mikro and Bootlab. His
projects include rolux.org, [textz.com](http://monoskop.org/Textz.com),
[project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), and Last Tuesday, where
people can “exchange mp3 files, beta-test new viruses from Asia or vote
for the most stupid new dot-com brand.”. He is also the author of “2 x 5
Years of German Internet” and other texts on the contradictions of the
network society. He is currently working on a fictional documentary film
set in Dubai.

Sebastian addressed the issues of e-book circulation, which he finds
impoverished by the current mediascape. As he went on to explicate, on
the internet we can observe two dominating trends: either gigantic,
difficult to manage ‘dumpsters’ of files, or personal ‘libraries’ of
ebooks, like Calibre. As a proposed solution to this unfavourable status
quo, Sebastian introduced his project [Open Media
Library](http://openmedialibrary.com/#about), which he developed
together with Jan Gerber.

Open Media Library is a local web application that lets you manage and
sync digital media collections. This library software can be described
as “something like iTunes for books, with other libraries instead of a
store, running in your web browser”. What Sebastian proposes in his
project is changing the mindset from peer-to-peer file sharing to
archive-to-archive exchange. Open Media Library allows users to see
other peers’ book collections, download them, create own read-list or
wishlist, upload and explore different ways of browsing and
display.

The software runs in the web browser and supports EPUBs, PDFs and any
other book format for which there is javascript reader, as well as plain
text. At the moment there is no stable version of the software and no
standalone installer, but users willing to try out the Open Media
Library can run it from Terminal(Mac) or PowerShell(Windows), following
[instructions on the website.](http://openmedialibrary.com/#download)
