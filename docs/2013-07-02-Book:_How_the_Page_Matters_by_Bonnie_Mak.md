> Mak’s book, “How the Page Matters,”
> historicizes recent debates about eBooks and similar technologies by
> casting the page as an interface that has been under development since
> the scrolls of Antiquity. “How the Page Matters” tracks the page
> through the manuscripts of the Middle Ages, the printed books of the
> early modern period, and onto digital displays. By locating the page
> in a broader tradition of writing technologies, the book re-examines
> the print and digital ‘revolutions’ and shows that the questions
> raised by digital theorists about the visualization of information are
> not new, but are instead the persistent issues in a long history of
> graphic reproduction. “How the Page Matters” contends that the
> material of the page is constitutive of knowledge; the quality of the
> paper, the shape of letter-forms, and the layout of text and image are
> all part of the conversation between designer and reader.
