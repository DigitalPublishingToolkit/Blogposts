last year within the Digital Publishing Toolkit research project,
Hogeschool van Amsterdam and Hogeschool Rotterdam together with various
designers and developers, collaboratively worked on the EPUB *From Print
to Ebooks: a Hybrid Publishing Toolkit for the Arts*.

This Toolkit is meant for everyone working in art and design publishing.
No specific expertise of digital technology, or indeed traditional
publishing technology, is required. The Toolkit provides hands-on
practical advice and tools, focusing on working solutions for
low-budget, small-edition publishing.

It includes answers on questions like; Is electronic book technology
really the way forward for these types of publications? Or does the
answer lie in some hybrid form of publication, in which both print and
electronic editions of the same basic content can be published in a
parallel or complementary fashion? And perhaps more importantly, what
are the changes in workflow and design mentality that will need to be
implemented in order to allow for such hybrid publications?

Everything in the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit is based on real-world
projects with art and design publishers. Editorial scenarios include art
and design catalogues and periodicals, research publications, and
artists’/designer’s books.
