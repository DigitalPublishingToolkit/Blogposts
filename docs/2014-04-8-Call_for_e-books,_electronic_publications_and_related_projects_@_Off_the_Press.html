									<p dir="ltr"><strong>Off the Press – Electronic Publishing in the Arts: Call for e-books, electronic publications and related projects on Friday 23rd of May, from 16.30 – 17.30</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">To illustrate the scope and potential of electronic publishing we would like to invite artists, designers, publishers and other practitioners in the field of electronic publishing to showcase their e-books, electronic publications and related projects in an informal setting to the public during the Bazaar we organize at the event Off the Press.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Off the Press will take place on the 22nd and 23rd of May 2014 at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and WORM in Rotterdam. It consists of a two-day conference with speakers such as Alessandro Ludovico, Elizabeth Castro, Adam Hyde, Badlands Unlimited and Florian Cramer, an arts &amp; Crafts session, workshops, and a Bazaar with Drinks. The following questions will be addressed: How can arts publishers make their own e-publications and use the medium in a conceptually and aesthetically interesting way? How do new forms of digital publishing change the role of the designer? What change is needed in your production workflow, from manuscript to publication, if you want to switch to hybrid electronic and paper publishing?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">If you would like to showcase your work or project at the Bazaar on Friday the 23rd please forward your proposal (Max 1 A4, max 4 visuals, and please indicate what technical equipment you would need) to </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="mailto:kimmy@networkcultures.org">kimmy@networkcultures.org</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. The deadline for proposals is the 22nd of April 2014.</span></p>
<p>Please note that contributions from abroad are welcomed. However, we cannot offer any accommodations or travel expenses.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Off the Press: Electronic Publishing in the Arts is part of the research project Digital Publishing Toolkit initiated by INC. It is a network of two applied universities and art school research departments, four Dutch art and design publishers and several graphic and media design bureaus, which are  working on an accessible “how-to” guide for electronic publishing in the arts along with a collection of open source software tools for editing and designing electronic books.</span></p>
