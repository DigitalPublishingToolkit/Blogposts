The pursuit of hybrid publishing – aiming at different output formats,
both print and electronic, for a single title – means reconsidering your
workflow from the first step to the last. A well thought-through style
guide is essential to make this transition to hybrid publishing
efficient, time- and money-wise. The style guide is sent to the authors
or contributors and defines how you receive your documents or
manuscripts. Adapting your style guide so it fits your hybrid publishing
goals beforehand will save a lot of time in production!

The Institute of Network Cultures has worked on the development of a
hybrid workflow, which is described in detail [on this
blog](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/10/07/hybrid-workflow-how-to-introduction-editing-steps/):
steps for the editor to follow, for the print book designer, and for the
ebook developer. In that manual we start from the point where the
definitive manuscript of the author is handed in and follow as it is
made into a InDesign/PDF document and an EPUB.

However, the workflow will without a doubt gain in efficiency when there
is attention paid to the nascent state of a publication as well: the
style guide used by a publishing house. In what follows the INC style
guide will be given as an example of how to adjust your publishing style
guide in such a way as to cater for a hybrid publishing workflow.

We’ll focus solely on the issues at stake in the transition to a
combined print and electronic workflow and will leave other elements of
the style guide aside. A copy of the style guide as used by the INC can
be downloaded
[here](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2014/10/Styleguide_INC__2014.pdf).

INC books are published on paper, as PDF, and in print-on-demand and are
freely available from the INC website. For more information on INC

**Language style**

**Document Formatting / Layout:**

*General*- Submissions should be sent preferably in .docx.

*We chose this format because of the editing and rewriting that is still
going on in this phase. Therefore the author is not asked specifically
to hand in a markdown file (see also the blog post about corrections
(forthcoming)). Of course, if the author is apt at working in markdown,
this is possible.*

The following points are about the formatting of the Word
file:**Normal** style as default.**Heading 1** style, article sections
should have **Header 2** and subsections **Header 3** style.*italics*
where needed (references, emphasis on single words).

*The URLs will be made clickable in a later stadium so they function
correctly in the PDF and EPUB. URLs in the footnotes however should be
clickable.*

*Footnotes and referencing*- All references should be auto-inserted
footnotes (in other words, no in text references that use
parentheses/brackets). For example, *not:* Off the Press discusses the
question of digital publishing (Lorusso, 2013). *But*: Off the Press
discusses the question of digital publishing. All
references should also be collected into a Reference list at the end of
the article. Please do not use an automated reference list, or disable
the macro after you finish making it this way.[…]

*QuotationsBlockquotes will be marked with \> in markdown and should be
highly visible in the original document, so the conversion can be
checked easily*[…]

**Images:**- Authors must have copyright to the images, or permission to
use them.

**Word Choice:**Does not apply 

**Footnote and End
References:**Does not apply
