\*\*CONTEC is a new, highly-engaging event experience created by the
Frankfurt Academy to address the complexity of the needs of today’s
publishing business. \*\*8th of October, Frankfurt \*\*\*\*





CONTEC gathers stakeholders from across the publishing ecosystem – from
STM and trade publishers to service providers and tech startups – in one
arena to redefine and redesign the experience of publishing. With a
special focus on new voices and technological innovations in publishing,
CONTEC highlights current trends, opens new horizons and provides
insights into an industry that continues to be in flux. It creates a
space for dialogue and market transparency. For more information about
