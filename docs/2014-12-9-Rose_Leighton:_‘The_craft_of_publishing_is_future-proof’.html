									<p>Rose Leighton is a lecturer at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and projectmanager publishing for the Centre of Expertise ‘Amsterdam Creative Industries’. She thinks that as the craft of publishing is getting more and more digitized publishers should reconsider their role to keep pace with the changing times. The first step in this process could be to scrutinize the book sharply. Is a book still a book if you digitize it? Or does it become something else? And íf a book for instance becomes something like a game does that make a publisher still a publisher or a producer of media?</p>
