Results from the
[epubtrailer.py](https://github.com/DigitalPublishingToolkit/epubtrailer.py)
script that converts EPUB files into GIF-format book trailers. The
script was originally written by Silvio Lorusso during the [Public
Library
hackathon](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/11/free-library-for-every-soul-hackaton-first-report/),
and is released as part of the results from the work of the [INC
subgroup](http://networkcultures.org). Here the script is applied to a
selection of illustrated public domain EPUBâ€™s available on [Project
Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
