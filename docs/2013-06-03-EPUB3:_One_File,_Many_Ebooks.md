> A single EPUB3 file can be used to create an ebook for all e-readers,
> explained Liz Castro, tech expert and author, at the IDPF conference
> in New York. […] Hachette’s practice of delivering the same EPUB3 file
> to all its e-tailers, including Amazon, sets a precedent for the
> industry, said Castro. If more publishers developed a single viable
> ebook file, would e-reader systems converge upon a single standard for
> rendering that file? And in turn, make ebooks a more intelligible
> medium for the reader?
