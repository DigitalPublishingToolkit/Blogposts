Rose Leighton is a lecturer at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and
projectmanager publishing for the Centre of Expertise ‘Amsterdam
Creative Industries’. She thinks that as the craft of publishing is
getting more and more digitized publishers should reconsider their role
to keep pace with the changing times. The first step in this process
could be to scrutinize the book sharply. Is a book still a book if you
digitize it? Or does it become something else? And íf a book for
instance becomes something like a game does that make a publisher still
a publisher or a producer of media?
