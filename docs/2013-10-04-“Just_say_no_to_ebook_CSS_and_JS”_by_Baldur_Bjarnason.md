> An ebook that doesn’t have structure is broken and unacceptable. […]

> I propose that ereader vendors simply turn all publisher styles off
> and never even consider enabling javascript. […] In exchange, what we

> support common markup practices like figures and captions, headings
> and subheadings, horizontal rules that don’t look like a 90s flashback
> and so on. Best if you support them both in markup patterns and as
> class-based microformats.
