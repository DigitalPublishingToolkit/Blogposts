**About the Book**

Can an algorithm edit a journal? Can a library exist without books? Can
students build and manage their own learning management platforms? Can a
conference be held without a program? Can Twitter replace a scholarly
society?



As recently as the mid-2000s, questions like these would have been
unthinkable. But today serious scholars are asking whether the
institutions of the academy as they have existed for decades, even
centuries, aren’t becoming obsolete. Every aspect of scholarly
infrastructure is being questioned, and even more importantly, being
hacked. Sympathetic scholars of traditionally disparate disciplines are
canceling their association memberships and building their own networks
on Facebook and Twitter. Journals are being compiled automatically from
self-published blog posts. Newly minted Ph.D.s are forgoing the tenure
track for alternative academic careers that blur the lines between
research, teaching, and service. Graduate students are looking beyond
the categories of the traditional CV and building expansive professional
identities and popular followings through social media. Educational
technologists are “punking” established technology vendors by rolling
out their own open source infrastructure.

Hacking the Academy will both explore and contribute to ongoing efforts
to rebuild scholarly infrastructure for a new millennium.
