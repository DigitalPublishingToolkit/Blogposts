Publishing between Open Access, Piracy and Public Spheres

12.11. – 14.11.2014 | Lüneburg, Germany

New media is dead! Long live new media! For three days, publishers,
researchers, programmers, designers, artists, and entrepreneurs will
discuss how research and publishing in the humanities have changed over
the past decade. The conference will explore new tools for gathering
knowledge, examine platforms for multimedia publishing, or collaborative
writing experiments.

Participants will focus on the interplay between pixels and print, and
discuss open and closed modes of knowledge, in order to seek out what
this elusive thing could be: post-digital knowledge.
