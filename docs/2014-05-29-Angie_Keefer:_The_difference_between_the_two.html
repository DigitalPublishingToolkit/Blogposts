									<p>Angie Keefer is a writer, artist, and co-founder of <a href="http://www.servinglibrary.org/">The Serving Library</a>, along with David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey of <a href="http://www.dextersinister.org/">Dexter Sinister</a>.</p>
<p>The Serving Library, as described by Keefer, is a cooperatively-built archive that assembles itself by publishing means. It first releases e-publications of the artworks and texts of various artists under PDF format, for free (but only for a period of six months), after which the latter are printed and sold.</p>
<p>However, Keefer’s presentation specifically focused on the house font of The Serving Library – called Meta-the-Difference-Between-the-Two font, based on the typesetting language of Tex – and how its digital origins relate to design possibilities. She allowed the audience to delve into the video titled “<a href="http://vimeo.com/65248695">Letter &amp; Spirit</a>”. The 18-minute production presents both a history and a philosophy of fonts by simultaneously playing with the animated typing it uses to convey the message.</p>
