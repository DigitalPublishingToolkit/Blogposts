									<p>Recently Silvio Lorusso launched the Post-Digital Publishing Archive (P-DPA). The aim of <a href="http://p-dpa.net/about/">P-DPA</a> is to systematically collect, organize and keep trace of experiences in the fields of art and design that explore the relationships between publishing and digital technology. The archive acts as a space in which the collected projects are confronted and juxtaposed in order to highlight relevant paths, mutual themes, common perspectives, interrelations, but also oppositions and idiosyncrasies. Pâ€”DPA is maintained by Silvio Lorusso.</p>
