*A contribution by Meeusontwerpt*

The subgroup of Valiz, Meeus Ontwerpt and Puntpixel has set out to
create a digital version of two editions in a new series by Valiz called
Context Without Walls. The paper versions of Context Without Walls –
books containing essays about and works by a contemporary artist – are
being designed by Meeus Ontwerpt and are full of design and conversion
challenges. Some of these include working with image-filled essays,
references in the margins and notes. As starting point we have decided
to try and make a simple e-pub that works even on the most primitive
devices (like e-readers). This means we cannot do too many crazy things
(regarding interactivity, but also with respect to the lay-out).
Therefore the result of this simple version will be quite dry. However,
by thinking well about details we want to make sure a certain quality
and a connection with the original book design are maintained.



**What did we do design wise, in order to achieve this? (For images,
scroll down)**

-   Convert the print colors to matching RGB colors (of course you
    cannot see the colors on every device, but we didn’t want to skip
    the colors completely).
-   Adjust the cover design to a one-language book (the original book is
    bilingual).
-   Start from a single-page design instead of a design in spreads.
-   Choose open source typefaces (through Google font) that come close
    to the original typefaces and that work well for the screen (Libre
    Baskerville instead of Plantin en Cabin instead of Akzidenz
    Grotesk).
-   Define styles for the text, titles, subtitles, notes, and keywords
    that work well for the screen (for instance the use of whitespace
    and notes, which are not shown in superscript, but in between
    brackets and in a color).
-   Set a standard rule for the use of images in between the text: there
    always must be three small images that form one image together. In
    this way the images still resemble the small images in the margin of
    the paper book.
-   Translate the visual essay in the heart of the paper book into an
    e-version. For example, in the paper book we use black as a
    background color, but in the e-pub that could turn out ugly since
    extra white margins might appear around the screen, that’s why we
    choose a white background here.
-   Add a content page in big letters, so it is easily clickable (this
    content page can exist next to the automatically generated content
    page of the device).
-   Add extra features that make the e-pub similar to the paper book,
    like endpapers.

**What is the next step?**

Puntpixel is making a generator that creates an e-pub, based on the
input of text in mark-up language. The design of the books will be
translated into the right CSS styles to use in this generator, so the
final e-pub is going to look like the original paper design.

Then we will have a simple e-pub that can be tested on different
devices. And the good thing is we also have a system to convert a whole
book to an e-pub (since we are working with a series that comes in very
handy). The important thing we have to sort out is how to easily make a
mark-up document from for instance a Word document.

The next step is to create a more complicated e-pub (e-pub 3), with more
possibilities concerning interactivity and layout. Unfortunately such a
version won’t be able to work on all the readers / devices. What we
would like from such an elaborate e-pub we don’t know yet, that’s
something we still have to decide together.
